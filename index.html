    <h1>Performance Analysis of Prim's Algorithm</h1>

    <div class="algorithm-info">
        <h2>Execution Time</h2>
        <p>The execution time remains relatively constant even as the number of vertices increases. This indicates that Prim's algorithm has good scalability.</p>

        <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
        <p>The space complexity increases as the number of vertices increases, which is expected. However, the increase is not too significant, indicating that the algorithm's space requirements are reasonable.</p>

        <h2>Graph Density</h2>
        <p>The graph density varies with the number of vertices. For smaller graphs (e.g., 10 vertices), the density is relatively high, but it decreases as the number of vertices increases. This is because the number of edges does not scale proportionally with the number of vertices.</p>

        <h2>Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation of Edge Weights</h2>
        <p>These statistics provide insights into the distribution of edge weights in the graphs. In this case, the mean and median edge weights are relatively close, indicating a symmetric distribution. The standard deviation gives a measure of the spread of edge weights around the mean.</p>

    <h1>Performance Analysis of Prim's Algorithm</h1>

    <div class="algorithm-info">
        <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
        <p>The execution time of Prim's algorithm remains relatively low and stable across different sizes of undirected graphs. This indicates that the algorithm's time complexity is efficient, as it scales well with increasing numbers of vertices. It performs particularly well even for large graphs with millions of vertices, as evident from the execution times being in the order of milliseconds to seconds.</p>

        <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
        <p>The space complexity of Prim's algorithm also scales reasonably well with the number of vertices. While there is an increase in space requirements as the graph size grows, it does not exhibit a significant spike, indicating that the algorithm's space usage is manageable. The space complexity remains within acceptable bounds even for large graphs with millions of vertices, as seen from the space requirements being in the order of megabytes.</p>

        <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
        <p>The execution time (in seconds) for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) tends to increase with the number of vertices. However, the time complexity seems to remain reasonable, as it does not grow significantly faster than the number of vertices or edges.</p>

        <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
        <p>The space complexity (in bytes) also increases with the number of vertices, but it generally seems to grow slower than the square of the number of vertices (V^2) for the adjacency matrix representation.</p>
        <p>For the adjacency list representation with a priority queue, the space complexity grows with both the number of vertices and edges, but it appears to scale more efficiently than O(V^2).</p>

            <h2>Time Complexity:</h2>

                <h3>Using Adjacency Matrix (O(V^2)):</h3>
                <p>When implemented using an adjacency matrix, the time complexity of Prim's Algorithm is O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices in the graph. In each iteration, we need to scan through all vertices to find the minimum edge that connects the visited and unvisited vertices. Since there are V vertices and for each vertex, we potentially check all other vertices (V), the time complexity becomes O(V^2).</p>


                <h3>Using Priority Queue (O(E + V log V)):</h3>
                <p>When implemented using a priority queue (min-heap), the time complexity is reduced to O(E + V log V), where E is the number of edges in the graph. In each iteration, we select the minimum weight edge from the priority queue, which contains at most V vertices. Inserting and extracting the minimum element from the priority queue takes O(log V) time, and there are at most E such operations (as each edge is considered only once). Thus, the time complexity becomes O(E + V log V).</p>




            <h2>Space Complexity:</h2>

                <p>The space complexity of Prim's Algorithm is O(V) in both cases. This is because we need to maintain a data structure to keep track of the vertices that are already included in the MST. Typically, this data structure is implemented using an array or a set, which requires O(V) space to store the information about each vertex.</p>

        <h2>Explanation of Graph Class Initialization</h2>
        <p><strong>class Graph:</strong> This line defines a class named Graph. Think of a class as a blueprint or template for creating objects. In this case, the Graph class will help us create objects that represent graphs.</p>
        <p><strong>def __init__(self):</strong> This line defines a special method called __init__. This method is automatically called when a new object of the class is created. The self parameter refers to the object itself, allowing us to access and modify its attributes.</p>
        <p><strong>self.graph = defaultdict(list):</strong> Inside the __init__ method, we create an attribute called graph for each object of the Graph class. This attribute is a dictionary (defaultdict) that will store the vertices and their corresponding edges. The list argument specifies that the values in the dictionary will be lists, which will store the neighboring vertices of each vertex.</p>
        <p>Overall, this line of code initializes a data structure (defaultdict) to represent the graph structure, allowing us to easily add vertices and edges to the graph object when needed. It helps us organize and manage the data related to the graph within each object of the Graph class.</p>

        <h2>Explanation of Graph Class add_edge Method</h2>
        <p><strong>def add_edge(self, u, v, weight):</strong> This line defines the add_edge method, which takes three parameters: u, v, and weight. u and v represent the vertices that the edge connects, and weight represents the weight or cost of traversing the edge.</p>
        <p><strong>self.graph[u].append((v, weight)):</strong> This line adds a tuple (v, weight) to the list of edges associated with vertex u in the graph. The tuple (v, weight) represents an edge from vertex u to vertex v with the specified weight. This line effectively adds an outbound edge from vertex u.</p>
        <p><strong>self.graph[v].append((u, weight)):</strong> This line adds a tuple (u, weight) to the list of edges associated with vertex v in the graph. This is done to ensure that the graph is undirected. In an undirected graph, if there is an edge from u to v, there is also an edge from v to u, and both edges have the same weight. This line effectively adds an inbound edge to vertex v corresponding to the outbound edge from vertex u.</p>
        <p>Overall, this method allows us to add edges between vertices in the graph, ensuring that both outbound and inbound edges are properly represented for undirected graphs. This helps maintain the symmetry of the graph and ensures that edges are correctly stored and accessible for graph traversal and analysis.</p>
      <h2>Explanation of add_edge Function</h2>
        <p><strong>Imagine you have a map with cities (vertices) and roads (edges) connecting them.</strong> The add_edge function is like drawing a road between two cities on the map.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>u and v</strong> are the names of the two cities connected by the road.</li>
            <li><strong>weight</strong> is how long or costly the road is.</li>
            <li>When we say <strong>self.graph[u].append((v, weight))</strong>, it means we're drawing a road from city u to city v on the map, and we write down how long or costly that road is.</li>
            <li>The line <strong>self.graph[v].append((u, weight))</strong> is like doing the same thing but from city v back to city u, making sure both directions are connected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, this function helps us build a map (graph) with cities and roads, making sure we record all the connections correctly in both directions.</p>

            <h2>Overview:</h2>
            <p>Prim's Algorithm is a method used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph.

By maintaining the edges with their weights in the priority queue, Prim's Algorithm can achieve the optimal time complexity of O(E + V log V) when using a priority queue.</p>

            <h2>Signal Strength:</h2>
            <p>Signal strength refers to the power or intensity of a signal transmitted from one point to another. In the context of communication, especially in space missions, it indicates how strong the signal is when it reaches its destination. A stronger signal is preferable because it reduces the chances of data loss or corruption during transmission.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h2>Data Rates:</h2>
            <p>Data rates, also known as data transfer rates or bit rates, refer to the speed at which data is transmitted between devices or over a network. It is measured in bits per second (bps) or multiples of bits per second like kilobits per second (kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps). Higher data rates mean that more data can be transmitted in a given amount of time, resulting in faster communication.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h2>Latency:</h2>
            <p>Latency, also known as delay, is the time it takes for a signal or data packet to travel from its source to its destination. It is usually measured in milliseconds (ms) and represents the time delay experienced by data as it traverses a communication network. Lower latency is desirable, especially in real-time communication scenarios, as it reduces the time delay between sending and receiving data.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
 <div class="container">
        <h1>Communication Factors in Space Missions</h1>

        <div class="term">
            <h2>Signal Strength:</h2>
            <p>Imagine you're talking to someone on the phone. If you're far away from a cell tower, your signal might be weak, and you'll hear crackling or your call might drop. That's low signal strength. But if you're close to the tower, your signal is strong, and your call is clear. In space missions, strong signals mean data can travel reliably between spacecraft and Earth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h2>Data Rates:</h2>
            <p>Think of data rates like the speed of a car. If you're on a highway, you can drive faster and reach your destination quicker. Similarly, high data rates mean information can travel faster between devices. In space missions, high data rates mean spacecraft can send and receive data quickly, which is essential for transmitting images, scientific data, and commands.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="term">
            <h2>Latency:</h2>
            <p>Latency is like the time it takes for a letter to reach its destination through the mail. If you live close to the recipient, it arrives quickly. But if they're far away, it takes longer. In space missions, latency is the delay between sending a signal and receiving a response. Low latency means quick communication, which is vital for controlling spacecraft in real-time and avoiding accidents.</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Summary:</h2>

With this matrix, checking for the shortest distance to a new city takes a long time because you have to look at every row and column. This is like Prim's Algorithm with an adjacency matrix, where it takes O(V<sup>2</sup>) time, where V is the number of cities (vertices).</p>
            <p><strong>With a priority queue:</strong> Now, imagine you have a list of roads sorted by their lengths, so you can quickly find the shortest one. This is like using a priority queue with Prim's Algorithm. It makes finding the shortest distance much faster, taking O(E + V log V) time, where E is the number of roads (edges).</p>

        <h1>Prim's Algorithm in Mobile Network Planning - Jio Example</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Scenario:</h2>
            <p>Jio plans to expand its network coverage to a new city with a rapidly growing population. The objective is to strategically place cellular towers to ensure reliable coverage and minimize infrastructure costs.</p>

            <h2>Application of Prim's Algorithm:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> Jio collects data about the city, including population density, terrain features, existing infrastructure, and projected growth areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph Construction:</strong> The city is represented as a graph, with nodes representing potential tower locations and edges representing potential communication links between towers.</li>
                <li><strong>Edge Weight Assignment:</strong> The weights of the edges are assigned based on factors such as distance between nodes, terrain obstacles, and projected user demand in different areas of the city.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Initialization:</strong> Prim's Algorithm is initialized with an empty set of towers and an empty set of edges in the minimum spanning tree.</li>
                <li><strong>Node Selection:</strong> The algorithm starts by selecting an initial node (tower location) based on factors such as population density, projected growth, and existing infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Expanding the Tree:</strong> The algorithm iteratively selects the next node with the lowest-weighted edge to add to the minimum spanning tree, ensuring efficient coverage and minimizing infrastructure costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> As the algorithm progresses, Jio engineers may adjust edge weights or consider additional factors (such as regulatory constraints or network capacity requirements) to further optimize tower placement.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation and Deployment:</strong> Once the minimum spanning tree is constructed, Jio validates the proposed network layout using simulation tools or real-world testing. Upon validation, the cellular towers are deployed, and the network is operationalized to provide reliable coverage to mobile users in the city.</li>
